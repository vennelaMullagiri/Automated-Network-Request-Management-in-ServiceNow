## Day 3 – Flows & Automation

*Objective:*  
Automate the Network Request process using Flow Designer. Integrate the catalog item, variable sets, custom table, and approval mechanism into a seamless workflow.

*Work Completed:*

*Catalog Variables Integration*
- Configured the “Get Catalog Variables” action to capture all required inputs:
  - Requestor Information (Name, Email ID, Department).
  - Network Details (Location, Device Type, Justification).
- Validated data mapping to ensure correct transfer into subsequent actions.

*Record Creation*
- Implemented the “Create Record” action targeting the custom table.
- Fields populated dynamically using catalog variables.
- Ensured consistency between catalog input and database schema.

*Email Notification Setup*
- Configured “Send Email” action:
  - Target Record: Created record in custom table.
  - Recipients: Requestor (dynamic), Approver (dynamic/static).
  - Subject & Body: Dynamic values pulled from catalog variables.
- Verified email sending and enabled mail properties in the instance when disabled.

*Approval Workflow*
- Added “Ask for Approval” action for the created record:
  - Approval Reason: “Waiting for approval”.
  - Rules Configured: Approve, Reject.
  - Approval Mode: “Anyone Approves”.
- Connected approval state to flow logic.

*Flow Logic*
- Implemented If Condition:
  - If Approved → Update record status to Approved.
  - If Rejected → Terminate flow with rejection status.
- Created “Update Record” action to update status dynamically.

*Testing & Debugging*
- Validated end-to-end flow:
  - Catalog submission → Record created → Email sent → Approval triggered → Record updated.
- Resolved issues:
  - Duplicate variable naming error by renaming variables.
  - Journal field warning ignored (not in custom table).
  - Email sending disabled; enabled mail sending in instance properties.

*Outcome:*
- Fully functional Network Request Flow established automating:
  - Data capture from catalog variables.
  - Record creation in custom table.
  - Email notifications.
  - Approval process.
  - Record updates post-approval.
