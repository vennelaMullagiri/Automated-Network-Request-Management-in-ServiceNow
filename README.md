# Automated Network Request Management in ServiceNow

This project implements an end-to-end automated workflow in ServiceNow to handle network-related service requests. It leverages ServiceNow‚Äôs Service Catalog, Flow Designer, custom tables and approvals to streamline how network requests are captured, routed and tracked.

## üìã Overview

Employees often need to raise network-related service requests (e.g., device setup, connectivity changes, new network resources). Traditionally these requests were handled manually, leading to delays and inconsistencies.  

This project creates a **self-service network request form** and an **automated workflow** that:

- Collects all required information at the time of request.
- Automatically validates and routes requests.
- Handles approvals and notifications without manual effort.
- Provides a single place to track the status of each request.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Provide a user-friendly Service Catalog item for network requests.
- Automate record creation, assignment, notification and approval steps.
- Reduce manual effort and improve turnaround time.
- Maintain a clear audit trail of every request.
